Switch Loop 
It executes code based on expression/input. It can run through different cases to get a match.
We can use a default case to execute when there is no expression matching the case.

Syntax:

switch(expression){
case expression:
	//statements
	break;
case expression2:
	//statments
	break;
default:
	//statments
	break;
}
