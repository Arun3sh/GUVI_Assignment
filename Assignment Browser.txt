1. Difference Between HTTP 1.1 and 2

HyperText Transfer Protocol is the way the computers and servers recieve and send informations.

HTTP 1.1 loads one by one, if one data is blocked all the other is also blocked.
HTTP 2 uses prioritization like it loads data which ever is ready first, say you're trying to send sequel films but 1 part is large in size and 2 part is small. Second goes first. Still the user will know it's the 2 as we can name it.
We can send multiple items through HTTP 2.

2. Difference between Scripting Language and Programming Language.

Scripting languages don't require compilation they use interpreters.
Programming languages use compilers.
The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs. 
As the compilers read the code entirely and throw errors that the code has.
But the interpreter will read the code each time and throws error at every instance one by one.

3. Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed

Statically typed language is the programmer has to mention the datatypes.
In Dynamically typed languages the programmer doesn't require to give the specific datatype as it will be done by the interpreter.

4. Rendering Engine

It helps to visuvalize the html and css content by converting. After parsing it is cinverted to DOM tree and CSSOM.
Then renders the tree construction. Finally painting the rendered tree.
