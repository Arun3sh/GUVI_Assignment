1. Is <head>, <body>, <html> Tags necessary?
	
	Browser accepts the code wothout those tags. But at certain times the content that should not be known for user may get displayed.
	Like the content in head may be read under body section. Also if there is any change to the style we can declare it under head rather than changing it in all places.
	So I think going with the tags can make coding better, even for any other than the original codeer to read the code.

2. Difference between <div>, <article>, <section> tag?

	<div> tag is used as a container. More like to hold multiple sectios.
	<article> tag has independent content that is different from one other. Example chapter name can be an article as they will have different pages.
	<section> tag is used to represent a themed or group of content. The whole webpage can be classified in sections holding different information.

3. Finding datatypes

typeof(1) - number datatype
typeof(1.1) - number datatype
typeof('1.1') - string datatype
typeof(true) - boolean datatype
typeof(null) - object datatype - It is object as it shows that the variable doesn't show any value
typeof(undefined) - undefined
typeof([]) - object datatype
typeof({}) - object datatype
typeof(NaN) - number datatype - Not a Number
